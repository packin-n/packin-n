I am an undergraduate researcher at Xi'an Jiaotong University, pursuing a B.Eng. in Materials Science and Engineering within the Academic Elite Program. I am also completing a Minor in Financial Technology.

I am passionate about the intersection of computational modeling, AI, and experimental materials science. My work focuses on leveraging machine learning and data-driven approaches to understand, predict, and design novel materials for next-generation technologies.

This semester (Spring 2025), I am studying at the University of California, Berkeley as part of the Berkeley International Study Program, taking courses like Properties of Electronic Materials and The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.
