- title: Transformer-Based Models in Materials Science
  role: Undergraduate Researcher
  description: >
    Assisted in developing ElementBERT embeddings by fine-tuning DeBERTa-v3-xsmall on 44,000+ literatures on shape memory alloys (SMA). 
    Processed tokenized data and configured a masked language modeling (MLM) pipeline for materials property prediction. 
    Applied embeddings to regression tasks (Random Forest, SVR, MLP, XGBoost) and used genetic algorithms for feature selection. 
    Implemented a feature-gradient Bayesian optimization pipeline to explore structure-property relationships.

- title: Collective Behavior and Quasicrystal of Vibration-Driven Active Particles
  role: Team Member
  description: >
    Designed 3D-printed active particle systems to study quasicrystal formation under vibration. 
    Analyzed kinetic mechanisms using high-speed camera recordings and Trackpy for trajectory processing. 
    Quantified diffusion and relaxation dynamics using statistical physics tools (MSD, intermediate scattering functions). 
    Identified a two-step nucleation mechanism involving dynamic phase separation and symmetry selection.
